It critically examines the mainstream narrative of the EU as a global leader in climate action and shows somewhat overlooked aspects of its waste management policies. It hopes to create a more nuanced discussion about environmental justice and sustainability.*"

    st.subheader("The Other Side of the EU’s Green Story")
    st.write(
        "The European Union is often celebrated as a global leader in climate action. From regulations on plastics and automobiles to initiatives promoting green innovation, the EU positions itself as a global leader in environmental stewardship. While these actions are true, how this dominant narrative has shaped global perceptions casts the EU as the ultimate sustainability champion. However, having a singular lens is dangerous. Moreover, the lens through which the EU is viewed—that it takes climate change more seriously than other regions, such as the United States [1]—creates the false impression that the EU’s environmental practices are flawless and universally leading. This impression overlooks critical gaps in its policies and practices, particularly in waste management."
    )

    st.write(
        "Sweep your own doorstep before you sweep someone else's. Before the EU critiques others for their climate inaction, it should examine its own environmental practices critically. Is the EU analyzing the right data and metrics to estimate its true environmental performance? These questions become especially relevant when we focus on the EU’s handling of waste, specifically the export of waste to other regions."
    )

    st.subheader("A Question of Responsibility")
    st.write(
        "A question to ask is if the EU is the global leader in climate and environment, why does it not process 100% of its waste? Instead of addressing waste fully within its borders, the EU ships some of it to other countries. It transfers the responsibility for disposal and recycling to regions less well-equipped to handle the burden than the EU is. This raises a critical question: if the EU claims climate leadership, why does it outsource the negative consequences of its consumption?"
    )

    st.write(
        "Waste generation is an externality in most markets, as producing goods inevitably results in waste. Some markets generate more waste than others. For example, the real estate market creates substantial waste during the construction of new buildings, much of which we still lack proper methods to dispose of [2]. Another example is food production, which generates significant waste due to plastic packaging. This particular issue has likely received more attention than any other form of waste generation since food packaging is the biggest plastic pollutant [3]. Neither consumers nor producers directly bear the costs of waste disposal. Instead, this burden often falls on municipalities [4]. This classifies it as a negative externality of production."
    )

    st.write(
        "Examining waste creation as a market externality highlights challenges similar to those posed by other externalities. One key issue with externalities is that different markets produce varying amounts of waste with differing impacts on the world [5]. For instance, we can agree that producing hazardous waste is objectively worse than producing non-hazardous waste when considering scale and consequences."
    )

    st.write("Waste treatment facilities themselves also create various negative externalities. Landfills produce leachate (a significant environmental concern discussed here) and emit landfill gases like CO2 and CH4 [6]. Other waste management facilities, such as incinerators, also contribute to environmental externalities through air pollution. However, these facilities generate more than just environmental issues. Property values decrease in areas near waste treatment facilities is another key issue discussed here. This happens due to occurances odor, dust, wind-blown litter, or increased occurrences of animals such as seagulls near landfills [6]. Additionally, there are indirect factors that significantly contribute to property devaluation, such as the fear of negative health impacts and concerns about a reduced quality of life for those living nearby (which leads to a decreased demand for such property)."
    )

    st.write("Given the cumulative negative externalities associated with waste and its treatment, waste trade becomes a layered issue. When waste is sold, the paying party (the one selling it) essentially pays for disposal at a market-determined price where demand and supply meet equilibrium (as seen in the picture). However, this price does not account for social costs like leachate management or property value loss. These unaccounted-for costs (the externalities of waste management) are instead borne by surrounding communities and municipalities responsible for environmental cleanup. Ideally, these costs should be borne by the payer (the seller), which is why many countries impose taxes on waste imports to mitigate these externalities. However, some costs remain uncovered, such as property devaluation and reduced quality of life for surrounding communities. That means these costs became burdens of already disadvantaged populations. Furthermore, corruption within the industry exacerbates this issue [7]; sometimes, the funds paid by the payer are not used to address social costs at all."
    )

    st.write(
        "From the EU’s side, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies are set to begin in 2025 to address these issues. EPR shifts the financial and operational responsibility for waste disposal from municipalities to producers and aims to help meet EU recycling targets [8]. This policy represents progress by redistributing responsibility, a step forward in terms of accountability as outlined in the Social Connectivity Model. However, it does not directly regulate how waste is disposed of, but only who is responsible for it within EU borders. Without addressing disposal methods comprehensively, this policy risks inadvertently incentivizing waste exports, which could exacerbate existing inequalities."
    )

    st.write(
        "The persistence of waste exports from the EU reflects an interplay of economic power dynamics, a 'Not In My Backyard' (NIMBY) mentality, and ongoing challenges in achieving safe and sustainable waste management. These systemic issues demand solutions that go beyond simple redistribution of responsibility."
    )

    st.subheader("Waste as a Commodity")
    st.write(
        "To understand the complexities of EU waste management, this project investigates the trade of waste by material types, including plastic, metal, and hazardous waste. Metal waste is further categorized into ferrous and non-ferrous, while hazardous waste is classified by treatment type, such as recovery, disposal, or unspecified processes. Using Eurostat data, these classifications help illuminate the distinct handling requirements and responsibilities associated with each waste type."
    )

    st.write(
        "This analysis prioritizes key variables to identify broader trends, revealing the unequal distribution of responsibility in global waste flows. By tracking specific waste streams, the project highlights the systemic inequities exported along with the materials themselves."
    )

    st.subheader("Mapping the Unknown")
    st.write(
        "Global waste trade operates through complex and often not transparent networks. Waste exports frequently go through multiple countries, making it difficult to know their ultimate destinations and fates. For instance, Malaysia is commonly reported as a destination for U.S. waste, yet evidence shows it also receives waste originating in China and Indonesia [9]. Given that Indonesia imports waste from the EU, it is unclear whether this waste is processed locally or further exported to countries like Malaysia. These convoluted pathways make it nearly impossible to ascertain where the waste ends up or how it is handled."
    )

    st.subheader("The Waste-Income Paradox")
    st.write(
        "There is a strong positive correlation between a country’s income level and its waste generation per capita[10]. Higher-income countries produce more waste per capita but also have better waste collection systems and higher rates of recycling and incineration (controlled incineration). In contrast, upper-middle-income countries rely heavily on landfills, while lower-middle-income and low-income countries often depend on open dumping."
    )

    st.write(
        "This disparity highlights a paradox: Despite having the infrastructure to manage their waste, high-income countries export significant portions to lower-income countries, where infrastructure is often inadequate. This practice not only shifts the burden of waste management but also amplifies environmental risks in regions less equipped to handle them."
    )

    st.subheader("Moving Forward")
    st.write(
        "The story of the EU’s climate leadership is far more complex than the mainstream narrative suggests. By critically examining its waste management practices, we uncover contradictions that demand attention. This is not just an exploration of data—it’s a call to question assumptions, address imbalances, and reimagine what true environmental leadership looks like in a deeply interconnected world."

As everyone creates waste (except for probably very few individuals), everyone in the EU is responsible for the situation and its improvement as everybody participates in the structural injustice. It is also an appropriate model as there is no one entity doing the harm but rather a series of choices of various actors that lead to the outcome.

        Young argues that this injustice happens because the system gives some incentive for it at every step of the way. For the EU's waste export, the main incentive is the lower cost of waste disposal abroad compared to the higher cost of disposal domestically. As researchers note, there is an incentive for companies to exist in the gray zone and export waste to countries with fewer regulations on disposal and pay for giving the waste to local companies that will dispose of it (DW Planet A, 2013). However, the companies could similarly claim that they are just acting in the way the market incentivizes them to. When waste is disposed of abroad, consumers do not see the consequences of their consumption and waste production and do not suffer the side effects of improper disposal. Moreover, it is cheaper to dispose of the waste abroad which is not only beneficial for EU companies but also for consumers for whom products are cheaper (as the cost of their disposal is lower).

        This way of looking at an issue shifts the focus from placing blame to distributing responsibility. However, a standing criticism of the SCM model is that the mechanics of responsibility distribution and, consequently, of taking action are unclear. Who bears how much responsibility? At what point can consumers say they did everything they could and their conscience is clear? At what point can companies say that? I would argue that these questions still arise from a place of blame and responsibility for blame rather than from a place of responsibility for an issue as a society. However, in navigating the current economic and political systems, there needs to be incentives for individual actors and entities. No company and few individuals are going to take action that is not the most profit-making, cost-saving, and time-saving. There needs to be a series of incentives in place for the desired actions (meaning those that battle the systemic issue or at least do not add to it) to take place.

        Research indicates housing values can drop by 5.5-12.9% depending on proximity to the landfill [9]. This means that if we add to landfills in lower-income countries or regions within countries, we are perpetuating the cycle of economic inequality by devaluating the properties nearby. The same argument used to justify (or used as a salient support for) not-in-my-backyard initiatives should be kept in mind when exporting the waste abroad. The fact that somebody will have to 'pay' for the landfill or waste disposal facility by devalued property does not go away when waste is exported. The property devaluation happens elsewhere. It is yet another negative externality of the waste market that will happen somewhere. Moreover, it adds to the argument that shipping waste out of higher-income countries to lower-income ones increases structural inequality.

        This is precisely what the Social Connection Model argues: the entire system bears responsibility because everyone treats it as if it's not their problem. The goal is to change this mindset—not to simply push for waste disposal elsewhere but to advocate for disposal methods that do no harm. A key step is improving corporate accountability, ensuring that recyclables are correctly labeled and that producers take financial responsibility for their products' end-of-life disposal. The broader aim is to establish a system of incentives that prevents every actor, at every stage, from defaulting to the easiest, most harmful option. Individuals play a crucial role in pushing for these changes—both in regulations and in the incentive structures that shape decision-making.

        The global trade in recycled plastic is widely discussed and often viewed critically. In contrast, the trade in recycled metal receives far less attention, making it harder to draw direct parallels between the two. While plastic and metal are fundamentally different materials with distinct properties and markets, the market for recycled metal is presently seen as having more potential. However, this optimism echoes the early enthusiasm surrounding recycled plastic as a solution to reduce reliance on virgin plastic [1]. One might wonder whether the recycled metal market will follow a similar trajectory, initially perceived as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative, only to reveal inefficiencies and unforeseen challenges, such as the influence of substitutes and negative externalities.

Yet, waste kept moving. The reason? Loopholes and mislabeling. A lot of waste was simply classified incorrectly, which allowed it to bypass regulations and still be exported [1].")

While the documentation requirements are stricter, given the history of weak enforcement, it is fair to ask: Does this just leave the door open for waste to keep flowing under a different label?")

            st.write("One major shift, however, is the increased power given to OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office). Until now, OLAF could only track and assist national authorities—like those in the Netherlands or Germany—in their investigations into illegal waste trade. However, it did not have the authority to launch its own investigations.")

Beyond what is officially reported through Eurostat (which this website’s data is based on), there is also a massive illegal waste trade. According to the EU’s own estimates, between 15% and 30% of waste shipments might be illegal. Obviously, these shipments do not follow regulations, making them far more likely to end up in landfills or open dumps [9].")
            
            st.write("The problem of high-income countries exporting waste to lower-income ones—where it is often dumped improperly—has been a known issue for decades. That is why the Basel Convention came into force in 1992, banning all hazardous waste exports from OECD to non-OECD countries as of 2019 [10]. The goal was to stop wealthier nations from offloading toxic waste onto lower-income countries, where it creates disproportionate environmental and public health consequences.")
            
            st.write("Similarly, the Rotterdam Convention (since 2004) has required countries exporting hazardous waste to obtain prior informed consent from importing countries [11]. But both conventions acknowledge that mislabeling, mishandling, and illegal waste trade remain major loopholes. And since these agreements are mostly declarative—meaning violations only result in diplomatic pressure—they lack real enforcement mechanisms.")
            
            st.write("Now, we also have Greenpeace’s 2022 study showing irreversible environmental damage from hazardous plastic waste in Adana, Turkey, where EU waste is also sent [12]. Maybe some of that waste arrived before the 2006 EU restrictions or the 2019 Basel Convention ban. But the study itself pointed out that most of the contamination was likely due to misclassified plastic waste—so whether or not it was exported legally is beside the point.")
            
            st.write("It is also important to note that Turkey is an OECD country. That means the Basel Convention primarily applies to it as an exporter rather than an importer. This does not mean there are no regulations for hazardous waste imports—it just means they are not completely banned for OECD countries.")
            
            st.write("In May 2021, Turkey briefly banned the import of ethylene polymer waste (a type of plastic waste). However, within days, this ban was reversed and replaced with stricter monitoring and regulations instead [13]. Otherwise, Turkey has largely aligned its waste export regulations with the Basel Convention and has been tightening its import regulations to match EU standards.")
            
            st.write("So, looking at all these regulations, the issue is not the lack of rules—it is the lack of enforcement. Maybe if all waste trade was banned, hazardous waste exports would stop altogether, and illegal trade would be easier to detect and prevent.")
            
            st.write("Otherwise, what is clear is that stronger enforcement is needed. The consequences we are seeing today are not because we lack regulations; they exist because they are not being implemented or enforced properly.")
            
            st.write("Given everything we know about the costs and consequences, the real question is: If we cannot regulate waste trade in a way that does not disproportionately harm lower-income countries, should we allow it at all?")
            
            st.write("*TLDR: The EU is banning all waste exports from 2026 and 2027. However, exports for disposal to non-EFTA and non-EU countries have technically been banned since 2006. That means, in theory, any exports to places like Turkey or India should have been strictly for recovery or treatment.*")
